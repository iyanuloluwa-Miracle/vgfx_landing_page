                <h2 class="ques">● Accounts</h2>
                <p class="ans">VYou must download the VIGILANT APP and create an account after downloading the VIGILANT
                    APP to be able to use the Platform. Our Services can be accessed on a computer, laptop device and/or
                    mobile device running an operating system supported by us. To log onto the Platform, you will need
                    to enter your User ID and other security information that we request, or when available, by using
                    biometric authentication which is a security process that relies on your unique biological
                    characteristics so as to verify your identity. The current supported biometric authentication
                    methods are touch ID and face ID methods.
                    You understand that when using the biometric authentication to log onto the Platform, any
                    fingerprint, facial map, or any other biometric data stored on your mobile device can be used to
                    access the Platform and your accounts and to give instructions for certain transactions. You
                    therefore should ensure that your mobile device only stores your own fingerprint(s), facial map, or
                    other biometric data, and will not store anyone else’s biometric credentials (e.g. fingerprint,
                    facial map or any other biometric data).
                    The biometric authentication on the Platform is performed by the biometric authentication module of
                    your device, and we do not control the functionality of any mode of biometric authentication
                    including fingerprint, touch ID or face ID. We make no representation or warranty as to the security
                    of the biometric authentication function on your mobile device and we do not have access to your
                    fingerprint(s) or facial recognition information. For more information on how the biometric
                    functionality works for your mobile device, please refer to your device manufacturer’s support
                    resources.
                    We may notify you from time to time about changes in the security information. We will automatically
                    log you out of the Platform if you are inactive for 3 minutes.
                    If you create an account via the Platform, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your
                    account and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other
                    actions taken in connection with it. Providing false contact information of any kind may result in
                    the termination of your account. You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your
                    account or any other breaches of security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you,
                    including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.
